# Visual Representation of Power Consumption in India during COVID-19 outbreak
This project aims to visualize the power consumption patern in India during the COVID-19 outbreak. I used the dataset collected by Twinkle Khanna her colleague. This data set is available for download on Kaggle.com with the name: [Covid effect on Power consumption in India] {https://www.kaggle.com/twinkle0705/state-wise-power-consumption-in-india}.

For data visualization I followed Kelsey Gonzalez's tutorial on animating ggplots in R. Please have a look at her awesome animation at her [profile page] {https://kelseygonzalez.github.io/portfolio/COVID-19%20Population%20Mobility/}.
